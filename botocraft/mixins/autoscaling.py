    This is a mixin for :py:class:`AutoScalingGroup` that adds some convenience

    :py:class:`AutoScalingInstanceReference` objects that get listed on
    :py:attr:`AutoScalingGroup.Instances`.

    EC2 is weird and doesn't have an easy way to list instances in an
    autoscaling group except to use one of the ``Filter`` parameters on
    ``describe_instances``.  Instances that are part of an autoscaling group
    have a tag called ``aws:autoscaling:groupName`` whose value is the name of
    the autoscaling group.  We can use this to filter instances that belong to a
    particular autoscaling group.

    This method is too specialized at the moment to be included as one of the
    transformers for model related objects, so we'll just add it as a mixin.
